<h3>Abstract:</h3>

The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Contractibility</span> problem takes as input two graphs <i>G</i> and <i>H</i>, and the task is to decide whether <i>H</i> can be obtained from <i>G</i> by a sequence of edge contractions. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Induced Minor</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Induced Topological Minor</span> problems are similar, but the first allows both edge contractions and vertex deletions, whereas the latter allows only vertex deletions and vertex dissolutions. All three problems are NP-complete, even for certain <i>fixed</i> graphs <i>H</i>. We show that these problems can be solved in polynomial time for every fixed <i>H</i> when the input graph <i>G</i> is chordal. Our results can be considered tight, since these problems are known to be W[1]-hard on chordal graphs when parameterized by the size of <i>H</i>. To solve <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Contractibility</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Induced Minor</span>, we define and use a generalization of the classic <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Disjoint Paths</span> problem, where we require the vertices of each of the <i>k</i> paths to be chosen from a specified set. We prove that this variant is NP-complete even when <i>k</i>=2, but that it is polynomial-time solvable on chordal graphs for every fixed <i>k</i>. Our algorithm for <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Induced Topological Minor</span> is based on another generalization of <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Disjoint Paths</span> called <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Induced Disjoint Paths</span>, where the vertices from different paths may no longer be adjacent. We show that this problem, which is known to be NP-complete when <i>k</i>=2, can be solved in polynomial time on chordal graphs even when <i>k</i> is part of the input. Our results fit into the general framework of graph containment problems, where the aim is to decide whether a graph can be modified into another graph by a sequence of specified graph operations. Allowing combinations of the four well-known operations edge deletion, edge contraction, vertex deletion, and vertex dissolution results in the following ten containment relations: (induced) minor, (induced) topological minor, (induced) subgraph, (induced) spanning subgraph, dissolution, and contraction. Our results, combined with existing results, settle the complexity of each of the ten corresponding containment problems on chordal graphs.
