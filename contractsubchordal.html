<h3>Abstract:</h3>

<p>
Modifying a given graph to obtain another graph is a well-studied problem with applications in many fields. Given two input graphs <i>G</i> and <i>H</i>, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Contractibility</span> problem is to decide whether <i>H</i> can be obtained from <i>G</i> by a sequence of edge contractions. This problem is known to be NP-complete already when both input graphs are trees of bounded diameter. We prove that <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Contractibility</span> can be solved in polynomial time when <i>G</i> is a trivially perfect graph and <i>H</i> is a threshold graph, thereby giving the first classes of graphs of unbounded treewidth and unbounded degree on which the problem can be solved in polynomial time. We show that this polynomial-time result is in a sense tight, by proving that <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Contractibility</span> is NP-complete when <i>G</i> and <i>H</i> are both trivially perfect graphs, and when <i>G</i> is a split graph and <i>H</i> is a threshold graph. If the graph <i>H</i> is fixed and only <i>G</i> is given as input, then the problem is called <i>H</i>-<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Contractibility</span>. This problem is known to be NP-complete on general graphs already when <i>H</i> is a path on four vertices. We show that, for any fixed graph <i>H</i>, the <i>H</i>-<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Contractibility</span> problem can be solved in polynomial time if the input graph <i>G</i> is a split graph.
