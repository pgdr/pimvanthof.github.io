Although I'm a computer scientist, I have never built a computer myself, never cracked software on my computer and do not know my IP address by heart. However, my laptop has no less than 4GB RAM, I can name quite a few elements of the periodic table (the first twenty by heart, as I still remember the acronym HHeLiBeBCNOFNeNaMgAlSiPSClArKCa that I learnt in secondary school) and I did, and still do, sometimes take notes in more than one color. This resulted in a nerd score of 49%, "Lightly Nerdy", with 49% of the participants scoring lower (less nerdy) and 49% of the participants scoring higher (more nerdy) in <a href="http://www.nerdtests.com/ft_nq.php" target=_"blank">this</a> quiz. That makes me very, very average, in nerd terms.
