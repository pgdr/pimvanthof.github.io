<h3>Table tennis</h3>

<p>
I used to play a lot of table tennis when I was young. For a few years, I even played in the national youth league of the Netherlands (albeit in the lowest of the three divisions), and I am the proud owner of 14 table tennis trophies. After a two-year break, I started playing again at university. However, being used to the attacking game of most youth players and now having to compete in the 'senior league', I lost to far too many grandmothers. So I gave up.

By coincidence, a <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/m.n.c.rhodes" target="_blank">colleague</a> at the Computer Science department in Durham happened to play for the university table tennis team, and offered to practice with me during the summer of 2007. At first, I missed the table by miles, but slowly the 'feeling' started to come back. I joined the Durham University Table Tennis Team). In the 2007-2008 season, the team managed to stay in the <a href="http://www.busa.org.uk/fl/cv.asp?divisionid=7880" target="_blanck">BUSA Premier League North</a>, and I managed to reach the last 64 at the BUSA Individual Table Tennis Championships in Nottingham. The following season was a bit less successful, as the team got demoted from the BUSA Premier League, and I went out in the group stages of the BUSA Championships.

In Bergen (Norway), I briefly played for <a href="http://www.laksevagbtk.no/" target="_blank">Laksev&#197;g BTK</a>.

After returning to the Netherlands in 2014, I started playing for <a href="http://www.ttv-alexandria.nl" target="_blank">TTV Alexandria '66</a>. A few years later, I also joined <a href="https://www.vice-versa51.nl" target="_blank">Vice Versa '51</a> in Oudenbosch, the club where I started my table tennis career many years ago.
