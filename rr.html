<h3>Abstract:</h3>

<p>
Given <i>n</i> clubs with two teams each, we show that, if <i>n</i> is even, it is possible to construct a schedule for a single round robin tournament satisfying the following properties: the number of breaks is <i>2n-2</i>, teams of the same club never play at home simultaneously, and they play against each other in the first round. We also consider a fairness constraint related to different playing strengths of teams competing in the tournament.
<!-- It is well-known that any schedule for a single round robin tournament with <i>2n</i> teams contains at least <i>2n-2</i> breaks, and schedules with exactly <i>2n-2</i> breaks can be constructed using combinatorial methods. Motivated by a local billiards league in the Netherlands, we study single round robin tournaments with <i>n</i> clubs, having two teams and one venue each. Sharing a single venue means that teams of the same club can never play at home in the same round. For fairness reasons teams of the same club must meet in the first round. We show that under these constraints a schedule for a single round robin tournament with <i>2n-2</i> breaks can be constructed if <i>n</i> is even. We also consider another fairness constraint related to different playing strengths of teams competing in the tournament. We show that if <i>2n</i> teams are divided into <i>n</i> strength groups of size 2, then a schedule for a group-balanced single round robin tournament with <i>2n-2</i> breaks can be constructed if <i>n</i> is even. --></p>
